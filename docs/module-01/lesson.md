# LESSON 1: JAVA BUILDING BLOCK

## CLASS DEFINITION


A **Java class** is the fundamental building block of a Java program.
It represents a user-defined Type which, as defined in programming language theory [See Syntax Building Blocks](syntax-building-bloks), specifies the kind of data and the operations (methods) that this new type supports.<br>
A class serves as the blueprint — the definition of the new type — while objects are concrete instances of this type, created in memory at runtime.
