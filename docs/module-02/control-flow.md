# Module 2: Control Flow

**Control flow** in Java refers to the **order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed** during program runtime.  
By default, statements run **sequentially** from top to bottom, but **control flow statements** allow the program to **make decisions**, **repeat actions**, or **branch execution paths** based on conditions.

Java provides three main categories of control flow constructs:

1. **Decision-making statements** — `if`, `if-else`, `switch`
2. **Looping statements** — `for`, `while`, `do-while`, and enhanced `for`
3. **Branching statements** — `break`, `continue`, and `return`

> [!TIP]
> Understanding control flow is essential for determining how data moves through your program and how logic decisions are executed step by step.
