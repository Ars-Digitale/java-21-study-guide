As we saw before in the [Syntax Building Blocks](syntax-building-blocks.md), Java has two categories of data types:

- **Primitive types**  
- **Reference types**

👉 For a complete overview of primitive types with their sizes, ranges, defaults, and examples, see the [Primitive Types Table](#43-primitive-types-table).


<a id="41-primitive-types"></a>
## 4.1 Primitive Types

`Primitives` represent **single raw values** stored directly in memory.  
Each primitive type has a fixed size that determines how many bytes it occupies.

Conceptually, a primitive is just a **cell in memory** holding a value:

```
+-------+
|  42   |   ← value of type short (2 bytes in memory)
+-------+
```

---

<a id="42-reference-types"></a>
## 4.2 Reference Types

A `reference` type does not hold the `object` itself, but a **reference (pointer)** to it.  
The reference has a fixed size (JVM-dependent, often 4 or 8 bytes), which points to a memory location where the actual object is stored.

- Example: a `String` reference variable points to a string object in the heap, which internally is composed of an array of `char` primitives.

Diagram:

```
Reference (4 or 8 bytes)
+---------+
| address | ───────────────►  Object in Heap
+---------+                  +-------------------+
                             |   "Hello"         |
                             | ['H','e','l','l','o']  ← array of char
                             +-------------------+
```

| `char`   | UTF-16    | 2 bytes   | `'\u0000'` (0)             | `'\uffff'` (65,535)        | `'\u0000'`    | `char c = 'A';` |
| `boolean`| true/false| JVM-dep. (often 1 byte) | `false` | `true` | `false` | `boolean b = true;` |

## 4.4 Notes

`float` and `double` do not have fixed integer bounds like integral types.  
Instead, they follow the IEEE 754 standard:

- **Smallest positive nonzero values**:  
  - `Float.MIN_VALUE ≈ 1.4E–45`  
  - `Double.MIN_VALUE ≈ 4.9E–324`  

- **Largest finite values**:  
  - `Float.MAX_VALUE ≈ 3.4028235E+38`  
  - `Double.MAX_VALUE ≈ 1.7976931348623157E+308`  

They also support special values: **`+Infinity`**, **`-Infinity`**, and **`NaN`** (Not a Number).

- **FP** = floating point.  
- `boolean` size is JVM-dependent but behaves logically as `true`/`false`.  
- Default values apply to **fields** (class variables). **Local variables** must be explicitly initialized before use.

<a id="45-recap"></a>
## 4.5 Recap

- **Primitive** = actual value, stored directly in memory.  
- **Reference** = pointer to an object; the object itself may contain primitives and other references.  
- For details of primitives, see the [Primitive Types Table](#43-primitive-types-table).

## 4.6 Arithmetic and Primitive Numeric Promotion

When applying arithmetic or comparison operators to **primitive data types**, Java automatically converts (or *promotes*) values to compatible types according to well-defined **numeric promotion rules**.

These rules ensure consistent calculations and prevent data loss when mixing different numeric types.


<a id="461-numeric-promotion-rules-in-java"></a>
### 4.6.1 🔹 Numeric Promotion Rules in Java

<a id="4611-rule-1-mixed-data-types-smaller-type-promoted-to-larger-type"></a>
#### 4.6.1.1 **Rule 1 – Mixed Data Types → Smaller type promoted to larger type**

If two operands belong to **different numeric data types**, Java automatically promotes the **smaller** type to the **larger** type before performing the operation.

| Example | Explanation |
|----------|--------------|
| `int x = 10; double y = 5.5;`<br>`double result = x + y;` | The `int` value `x` is promoted to `double`, so the result is a `double` (`15.5`). |

**Valid type promotion order (smallest → largest):**  
`byte → short → int → long → float → double`


<a id="4612-rule-2-integral-floating-point-integral-promoted-to-floating-point"></a>
#### 4.6.1.2 **Rule 2 – Integral + Floating-point → Integral promoted to floating-point**

If one operand is an **integral type** (`byte`, `short`, `char`, `int`, `long`) and the other is a **floating-point type** (`float`, `double`),  
the **integral value is promoted** to the **floating-point** type before the operation.

| Example | Explanation |
|----------|--------------|
| `float f = 2.5F; int n = 3;`<br>`float result = f * n;` | `n` (int) is promoted to `float`. The result is a `float` (`7.5`). |
| `double d = 10.0; long l = 3;`<br>`double result = d / l;` | `l` (long) is promoted to `double`. The result is a `double` (`3.333...`). |


<a id="4613-rule-3-byte-short-and-char-are-promoted-to-int-during-arithmetic"></a>
#### 4.6.1.3 **Rule 3 – `byte`, `short`, and `char` are promoted to `int` during arithmetic**

When performing arithmetic **with variables** (not literal constants) of type `byte`, `short`, or `char`,  
Java automatically promotes them to **`int`**, even if **both operands are smaller than `int`**.

| Example | Explanation |
|----------|--------------|
| `byte a = 10, b = 20;`<br>`byte c = a + b;` | ❌ Compile-time error: result of `a + b` is `int`, not `byte`. Must cast → `byte c = (byte)(a + b);` |
| `short s1 = 1000, s2 = 2000;`<br>`short sum = (short)(s1 + s2);` | The operands are promoted to `int`, so explicit casting is required to assign to `short`. |
| `char c1 = 'A', c2 = 2;`<br>`int result = c1 + c2;` | `'A'` (65) and `2` are promoted to `int`, result = `67`. |

!!! note
    This rule applies only when **using variables**.
    When **using constant literals**, the compiler can sometimes evaluate the expression at compile time and assign it safely.

```java
byte a = 10 + 20;   // ✅ OK: constant expression fits in byte
byte b = 10;
byte c = 20;
byte d = b + c;     // ❌ Error: b + c is evaluated at runtime → int
```

<a id="4614-rule-4-result-type-matches-the-promoted-operand-type"></a>
#### 4.6.1.4 **Rule 4 – Result type matches the promoted operand type**

After promotions are applied, and both operands are of the same type,  
the **result** of the expression has that **same promoted type**.

| Example | Explanation |
|----------|--------------|
| `int i = 5; double d = 6.0;`<br>`var result = i * d;` | `i` is promoted to `double`, result is `double`. |
| `float f = 3.5F; long l = 4L;`<br>`var result = f + l;` | `l` is promoted to `float`, result is `float`. |
| `int x = 10, y = 4;`<br>`var div = x / y;` | Both are `int`, result = `int` (`2`), fractional part truncated. |

!!! warning
    Integer division always produces an **integer result**.
    To obtain a decimal result, **at least one operand must be floating-point**:

```java
double result = 10.0 / 4; // ✅ 2.5
int result = 10 / 4;      // ❌ 2 (fraction discarded)
```


<a id="462-summary-of-numeric-promotion-behavior"></a>
### 4.6.2 ✅ Summary of Numeric Promotion Behavior

| Situation | Promotion Result | Example |
|------------|------------------|----------|
| Mixing smaller and larger numeric types | Smaller type promoted to larger | `int + double → double` |
| Integral + Floating-point | Integral promoted to floating-point | `long + float → float` |
| `byte`, `short`, `char` arithmetic | Promoted to `int` | `byte + byte → int` |
| Result after promotion | Result matches promoted type | `float + long → float` |


<a id="4621-key-takeaways"></a>
#### 4.6.2.1 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Always consider **type promotion** when mixing data types in arithmetic.  
- For smaller types (`byte`, `short`, `char`), promotion to `int` is automatic when operands of an arithmetic operation containing variables.  
- Use **explicit casting** only when you are sure the result fits the target type.  
- Remember: **integer division truncates**, **floating-point division keeps decimals**.  
- Understanding promotion rules is crucial for avoiding **unexpected precision loss** or **compile-time errors**.

## 4.7 Casting in Java

`Casting` in Java is the process of explicitly converting a value from one type to another.
It applies both to `primitive types` (numbers) and to `reference types` (objects in a class hierarchy).


<a id="471-primitive-casting"></a>
### 4.7.1 Primitive Casting

Primitive casting changes the type of a numeric value.

There are two categories of casting:

| Type | Description | Example | Explicit? | Risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Widening | smaller type → larger type | int → double | No | no loss |
| Narrowing | larger type → smaller type | double → int | Yes | possible loss |

<a id="4711-widening-implicit-casting"></a>
### 4.7.1.1 Widening Implicit Casting

Automatic conversion from a “smaller” type to a compatible “larger” type.  
Handled by the compiler, **does not require explicit syntax**.

```java
int i = 100;
double d = i;  // implicit cast: int → double
System.out.println(d); // 100.0
```

✅ **Safe** – no overflow (though still be aware of floating-point precision).

<a id="4712-narrowing-explicit-casting"></a>
### 4.7.1.2 Narrowing Explicit Casting

Manual conversion from a “larger” type to a “smaller” one.  
Requires a **cast expression** because it may cause data loss.

```java
double d = 9.78;
int i = (int) d;  // explicit cast: double → int
System.out.println(i); // 9 (fraction discarded)
```

!!! warning
    ⚠ Use only when you are sure the value fits in the target type.


<a id="4713-compile-time-implicit-narrowing"></a>
### 4.7.1.3 Compile-Time Implicit Narrowing

In some specific cases, the compiler allows a narrowing conversion **without an explicit cast**.

If a variable is declared `final` and initialized with a constant expression whose value fits into the target type, the compiler can safely perform the conversion at compile time.

```java
final int k = 11;
byte b = k;  // allowed: value 11 fits into byte range

final int x = 200;
byte c = x;  // does NOT compile: 200 is outside byte range
```

This works because the compiler knows the exact value of a `final` variable and can verify that it is within the range of the smaller type.

This kind of narrowing is allowed between:
- `byte`
- `short`
- `char`
- `int`

However, it does **not** apply to:
- `long`
- `float`
- `double`

For example:

```java
final float f = 10.0f;
int n = f;   // does not compile
```

Even though the value seems compatible, floating-point types are not eligible for this form of implicit narrowing.


<a id="472-data-loss-overflow-and-underflow"></a>
### 4.7.2 Data Loss, Overflow and Underflow

When a value exceeds a type’s capacity, you may get:

- **Overflow**: result greater than the maximum representable value
- **Underflow**: result lower than the minimum representable value
- **Truncation**: data that does not fit is lost (e.g., decimals)

- Example – overflow/underflow with int

```java
int max = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
int overflow = max + 1;     // "wrap-around" to negative

int min = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
int underflow = min - 1;    // "wrap-around" to positive
```

- Example: truncation

```java
double d = 9.99;
int i = (int) d; // 9 (fraction discarded)
```

!!! note
    Floating-point types (`float`, `double`) **do not wrap**:
    - overflow → `Infinity` / `-Infinity`
    - underflow (very small values) → 0.0 or denormalized values.

<a id="473-casting-values-versus-variables"></a>
### 4.7.3 Casting Values versus Variables

Java treats:

- Integer **literals** as `int` by default
- Floating-point **literals** as `double` by default

The compiler **does not require a cast** when a literal fits within the target type range:

```java
byte first = 10;        // OK: 10 fits in byte
short second = 9 * 10;  // OK: constant expression evaluated at compile time
```

But:

```java
long a = 5729685479;    // ❌ error: int literal out of range
long b = 5729685479L;   // ✅ long literal (L suffix)

float c = 3.14;         // ❌ double → float: requires F or cast
float d = 3.14F;        // ✅ float literal

int e = 0x7FFF_FFFF;    // ✅ max int in hex
int f = 0x8000_0000;    // ❌ out of int range (needs L)
```

However, when numeric promotion rules apply:

> With variables of type `byte`, `short`, and `char` in an arithmetic expression, operands are promoted to `int` and the result is `int`.

```java
byte first = 10;
short second = 9 + first;       // ❌ 9 (int literal) + first (byte → int) = int
// second = (short) (9 + first);  // ✅ cast entire expression
```

```java
short b = 10;
short a = 5 + b;               // ❌ 5 (int) + b (short → int) = int
short a2 = (short) (5 + b);    // ✅ cast entire expression
```

!!! warning
    Cast is a **unary operator**:
    
    `short a = (short) 5 + b;`
    The cast applies only to `5` → the expression result remains int → assignment still fails.

<a id="474-reference-casting-objects"></a>
### 4.7.4 Reference Casting Objects

Casting also applies to **object references** in a class hierarchy.  
It does not change the object in memory — only **the reference type** used to access it.

Key rules:

- The **real object type** determines which fields/methods actually exist.
- The **reference type** determines what you may access at that point in code.

<a id="4741-upcasting-widening-reference-cast"></a>
### 4.7.4.1 Upcasting (Widening Reference Cast)

Conversion from **subclass** to **superclass**.

**Implicit** and **always safe**: every `Dog` is also an `Animal`.

```java
class Animal { }
class Dog extends Animal { }

Dog dog = new Dog();
Animal a = dog;    // implicit upcast: Dog → Animal
```

<a id="4742-downcasting-narrowing-reference-cast"></a>
### 4.7.4.2 Downcasting (Narrowing Reference Cast)

Conversion from **superclass** to **subclass**.

- **Explicit**
- Can fail at runtime with `ClassCastException` if not truly that type

```java
Animal a = new Dog();
Dog d = (Dog) a;   // OK: a really points to a Dog

Animal x = new Animal();
Dog d2 = (Dog) x;  // ⚠ Runtime error: ClassCastException
```

For safety, use `instanceof`:

```java
if (x instanceof Dog) {
    Dog safeDog = (Dog) x;   // safe cast
}
```

<a id="475-key-points-summary"></a>
### 4.7.5 Key Points Summary

| Casting Type | Applies To | Direction | Syntax | Safe? | Performed By |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Widening Primitive | Primitives | small → large | Implicit | Yes | Compiler |
| Narrowing Primitive | Primitives | large → small | Explicit | No | Programmer |
| Upcasting | Objects | subclass → superclass | Implicit | Yes | Compiler |
| Downcasting | Objects | superclass → subclass | Explicit | Runtime check | Programmer |

<a id="476-examples"></a>
### 4.7.6 Examples

```java
// Primitive casting
short s = 50;
int i = s;           // widening
byte b = (byte) i;   // narrowing (possible loss)

// Object casting
Object obj = "Hello";
String str = (String) obj; // OK: obj points to a String

Object n = Integer.valueOf(10);
// String fail = (String) n;  // ClassCastException at runtime
```
---

<a id="48-summary"></a>
## 4.8 Summary:

- **Primitive casting** changes the numeric type.
- **Reference casting** changes the “view” of an object in the hierarchy.
- **Upcasting** → safe and implicit.
- **Downcasting** → explicit, to be used carefully (often after `instanceof`).
