# Inheritance in Java

Inheritance is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming. It allows a class (the *child* or *subclass*) to acquire the fields and methods of another class (the *parent* or *superclass*).

## 1. What Is Inheritance?
Inheritance defines an “@@ITALIC@@is-a@@ITALIC_END@@” relationship between classes: a subclass represents a specialized version of its parent class. This allows code reuse, model specialization, and hierarchical structures.

## 2. Single Inheritance in Java
Java supports **single inheritance** for classes: each class may extend only **one** direct parent.  
All classes ultimately inherit from `java.lang.Object`, which sits at the top of the hierarchy.

## 3. Transitive Inheritance
Inheritance is transitive:  
- If `C extends B`  
- And `B extends A`  
Then `C` inherits all accessible members of `A` and `B`.

## 4. What Gets Inherited (Short Version)
This chapter contains only a quick reminder:  
- **public** and **protected** members are inherited.  
- **default** (package-private) members are inherited only if subclass is in the same package.  
- **private members are @@UNDERLINE@@not inherited@@UNDERLINE_END@@

> **Note:** Full details are in the dedicated Access Modifiers chapter.

## 5. Class Modifiers Affecting Inheritance

@@TABLE@@
Modifier | Meaning | Effect on inheritance
--- | --- | ---
`final` | Class cannot be modified | **Cannot be extended**
`abstract` | Class may contain unfinished features | Must be subclassed to be instantiated
`static` | Applies only to nested classes | Behaves like a top-level class regarding instances
`sealed` | Restricts who may extend the class | Only permitted subclasses may inherit
`non-sealed` | Overrides sealing | Allows further extension down the hierarchy

## 6. `this` and `super` References

### 6.1 The `this` Reference
`this` refers to the current object instance.  
Java uses a **granular scope** rule:  
- If a method/local variable has the same name as an instance field, the local one “shadows” the field.  
- `this.fieldName` is required to access the instance attribute.

```java
public class Person {
    String name;

    public Person(String name) {
        // Without "this", we would reassign the parameter to itself
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

If names differ, `this` is optional:

```java
public Person(String n) {
    name = n; // fine, no shadowing
}
```

> **Note:** `this` cannot be used inside static methods because no instance exists.

### 6.2 The `super` Reference
`super` gives access to members of the direct parent class.  
Useful when:  
- The parent and child define a field/method with the same name  
- You need to call the parent’s constructor  
- You want to explicitly refer to the inherited implementation

```java
class Parent { int value = 10; }
class Child extends Parent {
    int value = 20;

    void printBoth() {
        System.out.println(value);      // child value
        System.out.println(super.value); // parent value
    }
}
```

> **Note:** `super` cannot be used inside static contexts.

## 7. Declaring Constructors in an Inheritance Chain
Constructors are **not inherited**.  
Each class must declare its own constructors.

## 8. Default Constructor Behavior
If you do not define any constructor for a class, Java provides a  
**default no-argument constructor** that calls:  
`super()`

> **Note:** Only provided if **no constructor is declared** in the class.

## 9. Using `this()` (Constructor Chaining)
`this()` calls another constructor of the same class.  
Rules:

- Must be the **first** statement in the constructor.
- Cannot be used together with `super()` in the same constructor.

```java
class Book {
    String title;
    int pages;

    Book(String title) {
        this(title, 0); // calls the other constructor
    }

    Book(String title, int pages) {
        this.title = title;
        this.pages = pages;
    }
}
```

## 10. Calling the Parent Constructor with `super()`

`super()` must be the **first** line of a constructor (unless `this()` is used).  
Used to initialize the parent portion of the subclass object.

```java
class Parent {
    Parent(int x) { System.out.println("Parent: " + x); }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    Child() {
        super(5); // must be first
        System.out.println("Child");
    }
}
```

## 11. Default Constructor Traps

### 11.1 Subclass Declares No Constructor
Java inserts:  
`Child() { super(); }`  
Works only if parent has a no-arg constructor.

### 11.2 Subclass Defines a Constructor but Does Not Call `super()`
Java inserts `super()` automatically — but only in constructors that the programmer did not write the call explicitly.

> **Note:** If parent has @@UNDERLINE@@no no-arg constructor@@UNDERLINE_END@@ → compile error.

## 12. `super()` Always Refers to the **Direct Parent**
Even in deep inheritance chains, `super()` always calls the constructor of the immediate superclass, not ancestors further up.

```java
class A { A() { System.out.println("A"); } }
class B extends A { B() { super(); System.out.println("B"); } }
class C extends B { C() { super(); System.out.println("C"); } }

new C();
// Output:
// A
// B
// C
```
