# Java 21 Certification Guide

This repository contains a **structured, certification-oriented study guide for Java 21 (JDK 21 LTS)**.

It is designed as a **living handbook** to support:
- Java 21 certification preparation
- systematic revision of core and advanced Java concepts
- engineers who want a clear, organized reference aligned with modern Java

The project is intentionally **documentation-first**, with modular Markdown notes and accompanying code examples.
