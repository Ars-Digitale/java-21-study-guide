# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering a contribution to this project.

This repository is primarily a **documentation-first, certification-oriented guide for Java 21**.
Contributions are welcome, especially those that improve clarity, correctness, and consistency.

---

## What you can contribute

You are welcome to contribute:

- Typo fixes and clarifications
- Improvements to explanations or examples
- Corrections aligned with Java 21 specifications
- Translation help (Italian / French)
- Small, focused code examples related to certification topics

For larger structural changes, please open an issue first to discuss the proposal.

---

## Contribution workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch  
2. Make your changes with **clear and focused commit messages**
3. Ensure that:
   - Markdown files render correctly
   - Code examples compile or run when applicable
4. Open a Pull Request and clearly describe:
   - what was changed
   - why the change is useful

---

## Documentation conventions

- The **English version (`docs/en/`) is the reference source**
- Translations (`docs/it/`, `docs/fr/`) should remain aligned with the English content
- Keep formatting and file structure consistent across languages
- Avoid introducing external dependencies in documentation

---

## Code examples

- Code samples should remain:
  - simple
  - focused
- Avoid adding framework-specific or production-heavy examples unless explicitly discussed

---

## Style and tone

- Prefer clarity over verbosity
- Keep explanations technical and precise
- Avoid informal language or speculation
- Use consistent terminology across modules

---

Thank you for helping improve this guide.
